# Heart Disease Prediction
Machine Learning project for predicting heart disease risk

This project applies Machine Learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data.  
The dataset used is the Heart Disease UCI dataset (from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)).

Project Goal: The goal is to build a machine learning model that can classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease (`1`) or not (`0`).
